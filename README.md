## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16 or later)
* npm

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    (This project uses a single `package.json` for both client and server dependencies).
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the backend server:**
    The server handles multiplayer sessions and PDF uploads.
    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```
    You should see the message: `Multiplayer server running on port 3001`.

4.  **Run the React frontend:**
    Open a new terminal window in the same directory.
    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

5.  **[Optional] Run both server and client:**
    Open a new terminal window in the same directory.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The current application is robust, but there are several exciting possibilities for future development:

* **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts for private, secure sessions and administrative controls for session hosts.
* **Optimistic Client Updates**: Make the UI feel even faster by applying changes locally before receiving confirmation from the server.
* **In-App Chat**: Add a chat panel for players to communicate within the session.
* **Action Log**: A running log of all major actions (dice rolls, token movements) to keep track of the game's progress.
