## Gamebook Studio: Multiplayer State Exchange Specification

This document outlines the real-time multiplayer state synchronization mechanism used in Gamebook Studio. It covers the overall architecture, the data exchanged between the client and server, and the failure recovery process.

### 1. How It Works: The Synchronization Flow

The multiplayer functionality is built on a client-server architecture using **Socket.IO**. The server maintains the authoritative game state for each session, and clients send updates to the server, which then broadcasts them to other clients in the session.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of the process:

1.  **Session Creation/Joining**: A user either creates a new session or joins an existing one using a session ID. The server creates a `GameSession` object to hold the state for that session.

2.  **Initial State Sync**: When a new client joins, the server sends them the complete, current game state to ensure they are synchronized with the other players.

3.  **Client-Side Updates**: When a player performs an action (e.g., moves a token, updates a character sheet), the client-side `SocketService` sends an update to the server. These updates are debounced based on the type of action to avoid sending excessive messages.

4.  **Server-Side State Update**: The server receives the update and applies it to the `GameSession`'s state. It then calculates a "delta" (the difference between the old and new state) using the `jsondiffpatch` library.

5.  **Broadcasting Deltas**: Instead of sending the entire game state to all clients, the server broadcasts only the delta. This is highly efficient as it minimizes the amount of data transmitted.

6.  **Client-Side Patching**: Other clients in the session receive the delta and apply it to their local game state, bringing them in sync with the player who made the change.

### 2. What It Exchanges: Data and Events

The communication between the client and server is event-driven. Here are the key events and the data they carry:

| Event Name              | Direction       | Data Exchanged                                                                                                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### 3. How It Recovers from Failure

The system has a robust mechanism for handling synchronization issues, such as a client temporarily disconnecting or missing an update packet.

1.  **State Versioning**: Every time the game state is updated, the server increments a `stateVersion` number. This version is sent along with every `game-state-delta`.

2.  **State History**: The server maintains a short history of the most recent state deltas. This allows it to send a series of deltas to a client that has missed a few updates, which is more efficient than sending the entire state again.

3.  **Client-Side Version Check**: When a client receives a `game-state-delta`, it checks if the `fromVersion` in the payload matches its own `gameStateVersion`.
    -   If they **match**, the client applies the delta and increments its local version number.
    -   If they **do not match**, it means the client has missed one or more updates.

4.  **Requesting Missing Updates**: If a version mismatch is detected, the client sends a `request-missing-updates` event to the server, telling the server which version it currently has.

5.  **Server Response**: The server then decides the best way to get the client back in sync:
    -   **If the server has the required deltas in its history**, it sends an array of all the deltas the client has missed. The client can then apply these in order to catch up.
    -   **If the client is too far behind** (i.e., the required deltas are no longer in the server's history), the server sends the **entire current game state** along with the latest version number. This is a fallback to guarantee synchronization, even after a prolonged disconnection.

6.  **Data Integrity with CRC Checksum**: To ensure that the state is perfectly synchronized after an update, the server calculates a **CRC32 checksum** of the new game state and includes it in the `game-state-delta` payload. The client does the same calculation on its end after applying the delta. If the checksums do not match, it indicates a desynchronization issue, and the client can then request a full state update from the server.
